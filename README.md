# Ranking Historical Figures on Wikipedia

### Summary
In this project, we attempt to rank all persons in each language in wikipedia. Our belief is that the resultant rankings depict the historical importance of the persons in that particular language.

Following steps were performed:

1. Extracted all pages in all languages from wikipedia and filtered out "Person" pages.

2. Extracted all links for the extracted pages and filtered out "Person" links.

3. Built a graph of all persons in each language with persons as nodes and links as edges.

4. Computed "Page Rank" of each language graph to determine the ranking of each person in each language.
